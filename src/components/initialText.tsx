I made this project using the *incredible* and *fabulous* page [RealTime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=ededed-0b0504-b8dfa4-0b2d31-8b3eb1&fonts=Poppins-Poppins).

This page is also made with [React!](https://es.react.dev) I've been learning so much this past weeks.

>React is a bit **hard** at the beginning because of JSX (I never used it before).

>But when you get *used* to it, creating components isn't too hard.

Also, I used [React-Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), a library that allows me to do this black-magic Markdown thing.

Other things I've learnt with React are:

- Managing the **state** of components
  - Styling React components
    - Working with React Hooks
